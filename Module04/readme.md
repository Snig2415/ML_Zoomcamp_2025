**Breakdown of Module 4:**


1. **Train/Test Split** – Split your dataset into training and test sets to evaluate how your model performs on unseen data.

2. **Model Training** – Train a logistic regression model using the training data.

3. **Predict Probabilities** – Use .predict_proba() to get churn probabilities (e.g., how likely a customer is to churn).

4. **Evaluation Metrics** – Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC AUC.

5. **ROC Curve** – Plot True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate to visualize performance.

6. **Choosing Thresholds** – Learn how adjusting probability cutoffs changes accuracy and recall.

7. **Cross-Validation** – Use multiple folds to get stable, averaged performance scores.

8. **Final Evaluation** – Select the model and threshold that balance performance metrics best.

Pet Adoption Prediction | Machine Learning Project  
Project Overview  

Animal shelters face a common challenge: predicting whether a pet will be adopted. Efficiently identifying pets likely to be adopted can help shelters manage resources, reduce costs, and improve adoption rates. This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a pet from the Austin Animal Center will be adopted (adopted = 1) or not (adopted = 0), based on historical shelter data from Kaggle.
